# quickreload

A tiny thing to make the browser reload when files are changed on disk.

Includes a command line tool and an express middleware.

Features:

- Zero configuration. Just add quickreload as an express middleware, or run `quickreload` from the command line
- Reloads css without doing a full page refresh
- Reconnects if the backend (websockets server) goes down

## Express middleware

```js
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  app.use(require("quickreload")({
    // options...
  ));
}
```

Valid options are:

- `inject` Will inject a snippet into all reponses with content-type set to text/html that loads the browser side part of quickreload. Default is true.
- `server` This can be an instance of `http.Server` (i.e. the express app). The WebSocket server used by quickreload will listen for incoming requests using this server.   

If using `inject: false`, the following snippet must be included in the source code of pages that should reload on changes:

```html
<script src="/quickreload.js" async></script>
```

## Command line

Install the command system wide using `npm install quickreload -g`

```
Usage: quickreload [options] [watchdir]

  Will default to current working directory if watchdir is omitted.

  Options:

    --css <extensions...>  Comma separated list of extensions to treat as css
                           files. The client will reload all tags matching 
                           link[rel=stylesheet] when files with any of these
                           extensions are changed.
                           Default: css,sass,scss,less,styl

     --js <extensions...>  Comma separated list of extensions to treat as js
                           files. The client will do a full page reload when

                           matches it will, it will not be  watched for 
                           changes.
